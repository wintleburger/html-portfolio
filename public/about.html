<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Daniel. I am putting time and effort into being a web developer
  I've had plenty of attempts at trying to learn code.
  I hope with everything that this attempt sticks!
</p>

<p>My fear is that I'm too old and that I won't be taken seriously.
  I frustrate myself, but I am enjoying this course that I am following along with.
  I can do it!
</p>

<p>I currently work a job that pays well. Well enough that I have been able to
  afford a house and a car along with many other items.
  It does not fufill me though. I don't feel like I am contributing to anything and
  and I would like to make some sort of difference.
  I don't know if learning web development will do that - but i'm hopeful.
</p>
